# Go-Game-Agent

Built a game playing agent to play the Go game against a bot with a win rate of over 50%. The objective of the game is to eliminate the opponent's tokens on a
5\*5 board and end up with higher number of tokens than the opponent, thereby winning the game. Implemented Mini-max Algorithm
and optimized it using Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce time complexity.
